						<h3>The Man</h3>
						<p>I was born and raised in and proudly claims Plano, Texas as his home. Though, I live currently with his wife and baby girl in Utah. My favorite activities include hunting, fishing, football, soccer, and occasionally protecting Gotham from The Joker(Bateman = Batman... hahaha). Probably my favorite thing to do though, besides playing with my family, is reading. A life long learner, I enjoys everything from history to fantasy and even the occasional coding reference book.</p>

								<h3>The Businessman</h3>
								<p>I have always loved learning as much as I could to get a holistic view of the world. Starting out as a EMT, I eventually made his way into the world of business and sales. There I enjoyed years of success as a salesman and manager in several companies. I helped to not only grow the revenue of his employers, but to also assist in the creation of sales organizations and the building of their methodologies and practices. Over my career the amount of revenue and growth that I was able to acheive for my employers can be measured in the 10s of millions.</p>

								<h3>The Developer</h3>
								<p>I have always been technically savy. Despite having done basic web site development since high school, I didn't consider it as a career choice until I worked for the worlds largest enterprice IT Software company, Solarwinds. While there I attended many trainings and classes to bolster my technical knowledge until I managed to pass the Sales Engineer test. It was at that time I decided that my passion really laid in the digital world. From there I began to teach myself coding while also attending Brigham Young University Idaho's to get a computer science degree. I have used these skills I have learned to create professional web sites for clients, and also to form a software company with a couple other developers, Reactful Bytes, where we focus on mobile app and web development.</p>
